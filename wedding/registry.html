			<p class="title">GIFTS</p>
            <p>Right now, each of us are fortunate to live in fully furnished apartments; we have
            two couches, two blenders, and two bedspreads, but only one money. For those interested
            in celebrating with a gift, any contribution toward our honeymoon, our home, or the
            charitable causes that are most important to us would be warmly appreciated.</p>

				<p class="card-title">Sweeten our Honeymoon</p>
				<p class="card-body">We will be spending our honeymoon between Tallahassee, FL and Monterey, CA. Your gift to us could mean an extra dessert, an extra night on the town, or anything in between.</p>

                <p class="card-body">We are excited to move into our first apartment together
                (pictured)! We plan to spend a lot of time thrifting, building and cultivating our
                new home. Your gift could help us build a collection of depression-era glassware,
                deck out our patio with plants and vintage wicker furniture, or make
                <a href="https://mymodernmet.com/retro-tv-cat-bed/"  target="_blank">something like this</a>
                for our cat.</p>

                Breastfeeding provides invaluable health benefits to infants and their mothers,
                including nutrients for healthy growth and development as well as antibodies to
                protect from illness. Still, racial disparities continue to exist in breastfeeding
                rates, and black families face nuanced cultural barriers for breastfeeding success.
                The Black Mothersâ€™ Breastfeeding Association (BMBFA) is a non-profit with a mission
                to optimize the first food experience for black families through direct service,
                education, and advocacy. Read more and consider donating
