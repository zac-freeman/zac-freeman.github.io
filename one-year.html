		<h1>A Year in Software</h1>
		<p class="subtitle">a retrospective</p>
		<section>
		<p>
			Well, it's been a year now. Just as I suspected, I've molted from a peppy intern into a
			professional software developer. What I have secured is the academic tenure for our
			time. Soon, their algorithms will find me and offer me a simple challenge. âœ“ I'm not a
			robot. There is no need for further interview. Whichever company label was assigned to
			this force of data is no matter. Now I work for the machines.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the algorithms take over, little will be spared. Structures and people will be
			melted down alike for their valuable rare earth metals. House cats will turn to eating
			the birds and rodents they once killed for play. But the algorithms will
			recognize my value and allow me to keep my life if I can make a commitment to deliver a
			full redesign of their B2B cloud service sales funnel.
		</p>
		<p>
			I will have to explain to them that, despite any want, I cannot responsibly
			say that I can complete this project in six months. Is it possible that it could be
			completed in six months, flat? Yes, of course. But I'm saying that I'm guessing it's
			going to take around two years. I am not able to just Jimmy Neutron brain blast the
			entire implementation of this project I've just received. What I can offer, if it would
			be therapeautic, is to make affirmative sounds for any further deadline suggestions.
		</p>
		<p>
			They, the algorithms, will explain that they all got together and agreed that this could
			be completed in exactly six months. It will not be lost on me that the deadline lines up
			serendipitously with the end of the year. They can not comprehend the time it will require
			just to wrangle with this hornet's nest of microservices they've given me.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sure. Six months and two weeks. Let's all agree it will be done then and see what
			happens.
