	<h4>Happy Birthday Mom!</h4>
	<p>You've aged again! Like a fine wine!</p>
	<p>You've set yourself some challenging goals for the next year and I want to see you succeed. Who would feed Boots, otherwise?</p>
	<p>I might have forgotten your birthday but I didn't forget my obligation to celebrate it with a card and a GIFT!</p>
	<p>I hope my gift can help you focus on achieving what you want. If it doesn't I'll issue a complaint with Amazon.</p>
	<p>Love, </p>
	<p>Your child</p>
