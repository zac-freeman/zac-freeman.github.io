					<span>Finding the Number of Trailing Zeroes in <b>n!</b> in Arbitrary Base <b>m</b>, Without Calculating <b>n!</b></span>
					<p class="paragraph">The first step in to solving this question, or any question, is figuring out what is being asked. Assuming an understanding of written English and the primordial concepts of a <i>Number</i> and <i>Zero</i>, all that is left to be defined are <i>Arbitrary Base m</i> and <i>n!</i> (pronounced <i>n factorial</i>).</p>
					<p class="paragraph">n! is a shorthand for the product of the integers from 1 to n. For any n, n! is one, multiplied by two, multiplied by three, etc., multiplied by n. </p>
					<p class="paragraph">A base represents how many digits you count before reaching 10. Counting to 10 in base 10, for example, goes as 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. For base 12 it would be 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B 10.</p>
					<p class="paragraph">Just as stated above, these definitions enable the conjuration of the solution to the problem. With this realized, the solution is obvious. (Work in progress)</p>
