\begin{rSection}{Education}
    {\bf B.S. in Physics \textbar\ Florida State University \hfill August 2014 - December 2017}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item GPA: 3.889
        \item Minor: Mathematics
        \item Additional Coursework: Data Structures and Algorithms, Partial Differential Equations, Communication in Physics
    \end{itemize}
\end{rSection}

\begin{rSection}{Experience}
    {\bf Systems Engineer \textbar\ AutoZone \hfill January 2020 - Present}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Used Python to add new features and automated integration testing to build and deploy pipelines
        \item Trained a cohort of incoming systems engineers to traverse and troubleshoot a network of systems running a custom Linux distribution
        \item Increased visibility into store systems by configuring rsyslog and Filebeat to upload events from the registers to a central server
        \item Hardened C++ payment processing software handling \$5B a year across 20,000 devices
        \item Served as the final reviewer for large changes ($\sim$10,000 lines) to the C++ software in the stores
        \item Collected, analyzed, and presented the performance impact of introducing Docker to the store environment using Bash, Perl, and \LaTeX, respectively
        \item Updated a custom C++ time clocking software to prompt employees with surveys to meet California payroll compliance, recovering \$2,000,000 a year in penalties
    \end{itemize}

    {\bf Software Developer II \textbar\ Frontdoor \hfill October 2018 - December 2019}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Led the software development for a security initiative, implementing reCAPTCHA for login and registration, session token handling, email verification, and ADFS SSO into a legacy ATG B2B site
        \item Integrated a 3rd party payment processor to meet new PCI standards for a legacy ATG B2B site
        \item Designed and built a microservice with Go and Docker to enable B2B clients to place orders in database without interacting with legacy ATG B2B site
    \end{itemize}
    
    {\bf Research Assistant \textbar\ UAH Heliophysics \hfill May 2017 - August 2017}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Created a model of gamma rays in a magnetic trap with the goal of reproducing real world data
        \item Used C++, CUDA, and the Runge-Kutta method to simulate many parallel gamma ray systems on various NVIDIA GPUs
        \item Analyzed data produced to discover novel behavior of cosmic rays inside expanding magnetic traps
    \end{itemize}
    
    {\bf Research Assistant \textbar\ FSU Math Department \hfill June 2016 - August 2016}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Created simulation of the flow of two liquids in a closed system with the goal of confirming the accuracy of results published in \textit{Physica}
        \item Used MATLAB and numerical methods for partial differential equations to generate 1D and 2D simulations and analyzed the physical accuracy of the data using energy conservation and the maximality principle
        \item Results from simulations contributed to the paper \textit{Maximally Preserving Finite Difference Schemes for the Allen-Cahn Equation using Operator Splitting}, presented at SIAM-SEAS 2017
    \end{itemize}
